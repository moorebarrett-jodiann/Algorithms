#### Alphabet Checker
- Challenge 1: Find out if your sentence contains all the letters of the alphabet.
- Challenge 2: What is the longest common prefix in a sentence.

#### Capitalize
- Capitalize the first letter of every sentence in a sentence.

#### Fibonnaci
- Check out the `[Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)`.

#### Fizzbuzz
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz". Instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#### Palindrome
- A Palindrome is a word that can be spelt the same way forward and backward ("racecar", "deified"). Use this program to check if a word is a Palindrome.

#### Three Greatest
- An algorithm for finding the three greatest numbers in a list of numbers.
